This backend is used by the Delego app available at
[AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/delego-mumbai-mun-2024/id1661612842) and will be available at PlayStore soon.

## Setup

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
(Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows, Docker Engine on Linux). `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
are the source of truth for dependencies.

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies (creates `.venv` with the locked versions):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/munsoc-mpstme/mundra
cd mundra
uv sync
```

> If `uv` says Python 3.11 is incompatible, an environment variable named `UV_PYTHON` is
> overriding the project's `.python-version`. Run `unset UV_PYTHON`, or
> `export UV_PYTHON=3.12` for the current terminal.

2. Create your `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the three required values:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - the password for the Postgres database. Pick anything for local
  development. Set it before the first `docker compose up`; changing it later does not
  change an existing database.
- `SECRET_KEY` - generate one with
  `uv run python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"`
- `MAIL_SERVER` - set to `localhost` for local development. The SMTP connection is only
  opened when an email is actually sent, so every route except `/register` and
  `/forgot_password` works without a real mail server. (`/register` still creates the
  account before it fails to send the email.)

If something else on your machine already uses port 5432 (for example a Homebrew
Postgres), also set `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` (or any free port) in `.env`.

> **Note:** an empty value is not the same as an absent one. `DOCS_URL=` is read as the
> empty string and *overrides* the default rather than falling back to it, which silently
> disables that documentation route. Omit a key entirely if you want its default.

3. Start Postgres and create the tables:

```bash
docker compose up -d db
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

The database listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so it is reachable from your machine but not
from the network. Its data lives in the `pgdata` Docker volume and survives restarts.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
uv run fastapi dev app.py
```

The API is at http://localhost:8000 and the documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

To run the whole stack in containers instead (the app applies pending migrations on
start):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Creating the first admin

Admins are ordinary users with the `admin` role. There is no route that creates the
first one, because someone has to be trusted before any route can be.

1. Register the account: `POST /register` with `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` and
   `password`. Without a real mail server this returns a 500 because the verification
   email cannot be sent, but the account is created.
2. Verify the email. Click the link in the email, or in local development skip it with
   `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/manual_verify?email=you@example.com"`.
3. Give the account the admin role, on the machine that runs the app:

```bash
uv run python database.py make-admin you@example.com
# in Docker: docker compose exec app python database.py make-admin you@example.com
```

From then on, admins manage roles with `PATCH /admin/users/{email}/role`
(body: `{"role": "delegate" | "oc" | "admin"}`). Every change is recorded in the
`admin_audit` table. You cannot change your own role.

### Running the tests

```bash
docker compose up -d db
uv run pytest
```

The suite needs Postgres running and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` set in `.env`. It creates a
separate database called `mundra_test` (dropping any previous one) and applies the
Alembic migrations to it, so it never touches your real data. The `GET /backup` tests are
skipped if `pg_dump` is not installed.

### Changing the schema

Tables are defined in `db.py`. After changing them, generate and apply a migration:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Read the generated file in `alembic/versions/` before applying it.

### Backups

The `backup` service in `docker-compose.yml` writes a `pg_dump` into `./backups` every 24
hours and deletes dumps older than 14 days. `GET /backup` (admin only) takes a dump on
demand, returns it, and keeps a copy in `./backups` too (so the same cleanup applies).
Restore with `pg_restore --clean --dbname <url> <file>`. Copy `./backups` off the machine
as well; a backup on the same disk does not survive the disk.

On a Linux server, `./backups` and `./qrcodes` must be writable by the container's `app`
user (uid 1000), otherwise `GET /backup` and `GET /qr` fail with a permission error.
`sudo chown -R 1000:1000 backups qrcodes` fixes it. Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows
does not have this problem.

## Backend Documentation

### Overview

This backend is built with FastAPI to handle authentication, delegate management, and MUN event operations. It uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage and includes key features such as:

 - User registration and login
 - Email verification and password reset
 - Delegate data querying and updates
 - Admin-only endpoints
 - Mumbai MUN–specific delegate routes
 - Automatic QR code generation
 
## Project Structure

 - **app.py**: Main entry point containing routes for auth, delegate actions, and admin tasks.
 - **auth.py**: Handles JWT-based authentication (creation/verification of tokens) and password hashing.
 - **config.py**: Pydantic-settings `Settings` model, loaded from `.env`.
 - **db.py**: The async SQLAlchemy engine and the table classes (`DelegateRow`, `UserRow`, ...).
 - **database.py**: Query functions. They return pydantic models, never table rows.
 - **models.py**: Pydantic models for the API (Delegate, User, ...).
 - **alembic/**: Database migrations. `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` read the connection from `.env`.
 - **docker-compose.yml**, **Dockerfile**: The app, Postgres and the scheduled backup.
 - **mails.py**: Sends email via FastMail (for verification and password reset).
 - **templates/**: HTML templates for pages like password reset, food selection, and QR scanning.
 - **data/**: JSON content served by the app (`rooms.json`, `schedule.json`).
 - **tests/**: Smoke, database and role tests, run against a real Postgres.
 - **utils.py**: Contains helper functions, such as QR code generation.

## Key Endpoints
### Below is a concise list. See the code for exact response and request models.

### Auth Routes

 1. `POST /register`: Register a new user (creates Delegate if needed).
 2. `POST /login`: Obtain JWT with email + password.
 3. `GET /verify_email`: Verifies email with token.
 4. `GET /resend_verification`: Resend verification email.
 5. `GET /forgot_password`: Send password reset email.
 6. `PATCH /change_pass`: Change an authenticated delegate’s password.
 7. `DELETE /account`: Delete an authenticated delegate’s account.

### Admin Routes

 1. `GET /hash_password`: Hashes the provided password (utility).
 2. `GET /backup`: Runs `pg_dump` and returns the dump (admin only).
 3. `GET /delegates`: Lists all delegates in JSON or CSV (admin only).
 4. `POST /manual_verify`: Manually verify delegate email.
 5. `PATCH /admin/users/{email}/role`: Set a user's role (admin only, audited).

### Delegate Routes

 1. `GET /delegates/me`: Returns the current delegate’s profile.
 2. `GET /delegates/{id}`: Gets a specific delegate (admin or same delegate).
 3. `PATCH /delegates/{id}`: Updates delegate data (admin or same delegate).
 
### Mumbai MUN Routes

 1. `POST /mumbaimun/register`: Register user as Mumbai MUN delegate.
 2. `GET /mumbaimun/delegates`: Returns all MM delegates in JSON or CSV (admin only).

### QR-Related Routes

 1. `GET /qr`: Returns QR code image for a given ID (generates if not found).
 2. `GET /scan`: Serves a page to scan QR codes.
 3. `GET /food`: Returns a page to update meal preferences for a delegate.
 4. `POST /food`: Submits meal preferences for a delegate.

## Authentication & Security
 - Uses JWT with a secret key.
 - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
 - Many routes are protected by Depends(get_current_user) to verify tokens.
 - Every user has a role (`delegate`, `oc` or `admin`). It is read from the database on
   each request, not from the token, so a demotion applies immediately.
 - Admin endpoints use `Depends(require_admin)`.

## Database Interactions
 - PostgreSQL 16 with async SQLAlchemy 2.0 (asyncpg); the schema is managed by Alembic.
 - database.py has async functions to add, get, update, and delete user/delegate data.
 - A Mumbai MUN delegate is a delegate plus a row in `mm_delegates` (country, committee,
   meals), joined on the delegate id.
 - Past MUN experience is stored one row per entry in `mun_experiences`.
 - Backups are `pg_dump` files (see Backups above).

## API Usage
 - Send requests with Authorization: Bearer <token> to protected endpoints.
 - For CSV output, add ?format=csv to relevant endpoints.
 - JSON responses generally follow the pydantic models from models.py.
